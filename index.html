          <p>
            We have deep relationships with many coffee growing communities in
            Africa. Their health and prosperity are important to us, and we have
            an opportunity to help them thrive, and to use our size for good.
            One way we support our global communities is through our ten-year
            partnership with (RED) â€“ thanks to you weâ€™ve contributed more than
            $14 million and counting. All donations generated through
            (STARBUCKS)RED campaigns have gone to the Global Fund to help
            finance HIV/AIDS prevention, education and treatment programs.

            <h2>BRASIL BLEND</h2>
            <p>
              Ah, Brasil Blend! This coffee, 100% Arabica, comes from grains
              from the regions of Minas Gerais, SÃ£o Paulo and Bahia. The blend
              of medium roast, with a washed processing method, has a very good
              flavor balanced, with notes of chocolate. It was developed in
              2006, with the arrival of StarbucksÂ® in the country, to please the
              palate Brazilian, one of the most demanding in the world.
